# Contributing to Tron

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Tron**!
We welcome contributions from the community and are committed to building a reliable, developer-friendly Internal Developer Platform.

This document explains how to get started, how to propose changes, and how to collaborate effectively with maintainers.

## 🧩 Types of Contributions

You can contribute in many ways, including:

- Reporting bugs
- Proposing new features
- Improving documentation
- Fixing issues
- Enhancing performance
- Adding new integrations or templates
- Sharing real-world usage feedback

All contributions are valuable — even small ones.

---

## 🐞 Reporting Issues

Before opening a new issue:

1. Check existing issues to avoid duplicates.
2. Include as much detail as possible:
   - Expected behavior
   - Actual behavior
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Environment details
   - Logs and/or screenshots (optional)

Issues that are clear and reproducible are easier to fix.

---

## 💡 Proposing Enhancements

If you want to propose a feature:

- Describe the **problem** (not only the solution)
- Explain **why** it is useful for users
- Provide **examples or use-cases**
- Reference any related issues

Features should align with Tron’s goals:

> Simplify Kubernetes
> Improve Developer Experience
> Provide consistency & automation

---

## 🔀 Pull Requests

Before submitting a Pull Request:

1. Open an issue or start a discussion (recommended for non-trivial work)
2. Ensure your branch is up-to-date with `main`
3. Add tests or update documentation if behavior changes

PR guidelines:

- Keep changes focused and incremental
- Avoid mixing refactoring and feature changes
- Write clear commit messages
- Link related issues (e.g., `Closes #123`)

Maintainers may request adjustments for clarity, scope, or quality.

## 📦 Project Structure

The project is evolving. Main components include:

- **Core API** (workloads, webapps, workers, cron, exposure)
- **Portal** (UI for developers & platform teams)
- **Runtime Templates** (Kubernetes resource generation)
- **Cluster Integrations**
- **Build & Deploy logic**
- **Documentation**

If uncertain where your contribution fits, open an issue to discuss.

## 🎨 Code Style

Tron aims to maintain:

- Readable code
- Consistent naming
- Clear abstractions
- Minimal surprises
- Good separation of concerns

Refactoring is welcome when it improves clarity and maintainability.

---

## 🧪 Testing

Tests are encouraged for:

- Business logic
- Resource/template generation
- Cluster integrations (mocked)
- Edge cases

End-to-end tests are welcome but optional at this stage.

---

## 📝 Documentation

Documentation improvements are always welcome.
Good docs reduce support burden and improve adoption.

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap Alignment

Large features should align with the project roadmap.
If unsure, discuss first to avoid duplicated or abandoned work.

---

## 🤝 Communication & Respect

We value respectful and constructive collaboration.

Arguments should remain technical and professional.

---

## 🔐 Security & Vulnerabilities

Do **not** report security issues publicly.
Please contact maintainers directly or use the security disclosure process (to be documented).

---

## 📜 License & CLA

By contributing, you agree that:

- Your contributions will be licensed under the project's license (Apache-2.0 unless otherwise noted)
- A Contributor License Agreement (CLA) may be introduced later to support commercial governance
